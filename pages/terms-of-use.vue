          terms and conditions where we reasonably believe your rights will not
          be affected. These terms and conditions may be varied by us from time
          to time. Such revised terms will apply to the Website from the date of

          or competent authority finds that any provision of these terms and
          conditions (or part of any provision) is invalid, illegal or
          unenforceable, that provision or part-provision will, to the extent
          required, be deemed to be deleted, and the validity and enforceability
          of the other provisions of these terms and conditions will not be
          affected. Unless otherwise agreed, no delay, act or omission by a
          party in exercising any right or remedy will be deemed a waiver of
          that, or any other, right or remedy. This Agreement shall be governed
          by and interpreted according to the law of England and Wales and all
          disputes arising under the Agreement (including non-contractual
          disputes or claims) shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
